# Spring Boot Pet Clinic Application

***Status: Incomplete***

***IMPORTANTE: During the lecture of this project, we had to deploy using a Maven Plugin our project, but unfortly, in order for that to work, the project had to be on main branch. With the approach that I took of having an unique branch per project, the deploy was not possible. Nonetheless, the configuration will be left there.
